# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaingns
Using the Kickstarter Campaign Data to determine their outcomes and help Louise plan her campaign.
## Overview of Project
For this project we used Microsoft Excel to extract the relevant data  that would help Louise plan  a successful campaign  for her play in the US. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the challenge was to help Louise plan a successful campaign for her play.

## Analysis and Challenges.
To properly and efficiently analyze the Data, we had to break the information down to smaller portion using different sheets in Excel,
  Some challenges along the way will be  creating the correct (Count IFS ) formular  to achieve the  the true  information.
I overcame this by using the resources available to me  e.g Google, and the Module. and also just trying different ways of inputing the formula.
 Another challenge was paying attention to the sheets and making sure to only filter  and select the right column. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To accurately help Louise determine the best time to launch her campaign we had to first look at when the campaigns in the Kickstarter Data were held,
and how they did. We filtered the information to show campaigns launched in Theater from the Parent Category and the years.
we then focused on the campaigns that were successful, failed and or were canceled. We then created a Pivot chart that
showed May was the best month to launch a Theatre campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To also help Louise set a campaign goal that had a better chance of being successful, We broke the information down even furthur to show
 which projects succeeded based on the Goals. This showed that Campaign goals that ranged between $1000 to $5000 had a high success rate. 
 we also created a visual representation for the different Goal ranges and their  outcomes based on which range was successful, failed or canceled.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 Some challenges along the way will be  creating the correct (Count IFS ) formular  to achieve the  the true  information.
I overcame this by using the resources available to me  e.g Google, and the Module and also just trying different ways of inputing the formula.

## Results
We were able to present Louise with enough data to launch a successful campaign based ont he Kickstarter data.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May was the best Month to launch a Theatre campaign, followed by June. The Graph also showed December to be the worst month to launch a theatre campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
That Goals that ranged from $1000-$5000 were more successful that the others even though that range also had a high failure rate.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a table that shows whether the length of a campaign had any effect on its outcome.
another might be a table based on how well the campaign might do in different countries.
